        alert(counter());"

        Ans= 
             It will show alert one time that time alert is 1 ,
             but second time function will run and than counter value
              has been increase by 1 so that time counter value is 2
              same thing in a third and for time alert show and counter 
              value increaseby +1 .

    <h2>Q.2 what is the output?</h2>
    <pre>
        "let count = 0;
         (function () {
            if (count === 0) {
              let count = 1;
               console.log(count); // What is logged?
             }
          console.log(count); // What is logged?
          })();"


    ans = 
          output of the code is 1,0
          because we have console count first inside the block and then we have console
          the count in a functional scope so output is 0 from the global swcope.
    </pre>

    <h2>Q.3 what is the output?</h2>
    <pre>
        "for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            setTimeout(function log() {
              console.log(i); // What is logged?
            }, 1000);
          }"


    ans = 
          first the for loop has been run and the value of i=" 3 " so in a setTimeout function it will run and console 3  and then itwill work so 
          the oputput is 3 time 3 in a one second of time period.

    <h2>Q.4 Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should accept parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.</h2>

            function inner(breadth){
                console.log(breadth*length)
            }
            inner(5)
        }
        outer(10)

       When  outer() called so iside the length value is 10 
       & inner() called so breadth = 5
       and area of rectangle is = 50
        
       breadth*length 
       5*10 = 50

    <h2>Q.5 Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it is called </h2>

    ans = 
        var a = 12;
        (function () {
          alert(a);
        })();

        output is 12 in the alert windowe becaouse the variable 
        is in global so we can see the alert in the window 
        and "var" also has global scope.

 ans=     output is 12 var a = redeclair inide the function
          scope so alert prompt shown output is 12
